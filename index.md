  I am PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I work with Prof. John Pauly, Shreyas Vasanawala and Kawin Setsompop. Before joining Stanford, I received my MSc and BSc degrees from Electrical Engineering at Bilkent University, where I worked with Prof. Tolga Cukur.

        As AI systems are increasingly deployed in complex tasks and real-world applications, I believe it's crucial to understand and improve their reasoning and reliability. My work addresses challenges like quantifying uncertainty, performing efficient search and sampling, and ensuring reliable reasoning, all of which are fundamental for safe and effective AI deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        One major focus has been the development of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), a framework that connects reinforcement learning and probabilistic modeling. I've worked on establishing the theoretical foundations of GFlowNets, demonstrating their effectiveness in Bayesian inference of discrete and continuous structures, and showing their ability to handle multimodal distributions better than traditional variational methods. I also created and released <a href="https://github.com/GFNOrg/torchgfn" target="_blank">torchgfn</a>, an open-source software framework, to make GFlowNets more accessible for both discrete and general applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond GFlowNets, I've also contributed to uncertainty estimation through a method called DEUP (Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction). DEUP addresses model misspecification in interactive learning settings by using a secondary predictor trained on the main model's errors. This results in more reliable uncertainty estimates for decision-making in downstream tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm focused on scaling GFlowNets to tackle more complex problems, using them to enhance Large Language Model reasoning, and developing even better uncertainty estimation methods. My overall goal is to improve the reliability, efficiency, and reasoning capabilities of AI systems, particularly in scenarios that demand robust decision-making under uncertainty.

    Ultimately, I am driven by a deep interest in understanding and defining intelligence, whether it's in animals or artificial systems. While I'm excited about the potential of AI, I'm also mindful of its limitations and potential pitfalls – I'm definitely not a technosolutionist.
