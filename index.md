    I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, working with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/">Prof. John Pauly</a>, where I develop efficient generative models for medical image recovery. 
    I am also a student researcher at <a href="https://research.google/">Google Research</a>, focusing on building robust pipelines to enhance the performance of large visionâ€“language models such as Gemini. 
    Previously, I was a software engineering intern at <a href="https://careers.google.com/">Google</a> and a research intern at <a href="https://www.bosch-ai.com/">Bosch AI</a>, where I developed LLM-guided generative models for long-tail data augmentation.
