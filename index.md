  I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University, working with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/">Prof. John Pauly</a>. My research focuses on building generative foundation models for medical imaging, with a focus on image-to-image translation to synthesize missing data, recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones, and frameworks for dynamic time-series imaging. Importantly, I investigate methods to integrate text descriptions as an additional guidance, while emphasizing data-efficient and interpretable pipelines.

  In Fall 2025, I’m a student researcher at Google, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XI8oQn8AAAAJ&hl=en">Feng Yang</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5aAbqZIAAAAJ&hl=en">Joseph Li</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Vd3jzs4AAAAJ">Sikun Lin</a> to build next-generation frameworks for vision–language models and <strong>Gemini</strong>. I previously interned as a software engineer in the same team during Summer 2025.
